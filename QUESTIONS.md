# Reflection Questions

Answer these questions thoroughly, using examples from your code. Good answers will be 1-2 paragraphs that cite specific code examples and show a meaningful reflection on how your development went, and how it could be improved in the future.

In part 2, you now have to support two different inputs, CSV and XLSX. Imagine we asked you to also support reading in another file format, such as JSON. How much code would you need to add/change to enable this? Cite specific existing functions/classes that would need to change.
